# COVID-19
This is a website about corona and how its spreading and how we can prevent it.

	        <h1>COVID-19 [2020]</h1>
			
             <p>Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 spreads between people through direct,
indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected
people via mouth and nose secretions. These include saliva, respiratory secretions
or secretion droplets. These are released from the mouth or nose when an infected
person coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings, for example. People who are in close
contact (within 1 metre) with an infected person can catch COVID-19 when those
infectious droplets get into their mouth, nose or eyes.</p>
<p>To avoid contact with these droplets, it is important to stay at least 1 metre away
from others, clean hands frequently, and cover the mouth with a tissue or cover your
mouth while sneezing or coughing. When physical distancing (standing one metre or
more away) is not possible, wearing a fabric mask is an important measure to protect
others. Cleaning hands frequently is also critical.while wearing a mask never try to
adjust it with our hand especially childrens. Personal hygiene is very important.</p>

<h1>Prevention methods are listed below;</h1>
<p>1.Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or
wash them with soap and water.</p>
<p>2 Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others.</p>
<p>3 Avoid going to crowded places.</p>
<p>4 Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
1<p> Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or
wash them with soap and water. Washing your hands with soap and water or using
alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</p>


<p>2 Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. When
someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their
nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the
droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease</p>

<p>3 Avoid going to crowded places.Where people come together in crowds, you are
more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is
more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet)</p>


<p>4 Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up
viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or
mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.</p>


<p>5 Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This
means covering your mouth and nose with your hands or tissue when you cough or
sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands.Dropletsspread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around
you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</p>

<p>6 Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache,
mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave
your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others.Avoiding contact with others will
protect them from possible COVID-19 and other virus</p>

<p>7 If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call
by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health
authority. National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on
the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to
quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help
prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</p>

<p>8 Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or
your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are
best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect
themselves</p>
